# Exercise 1 : Grading Program
# Instructions
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values.

# The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.

# DO NOT write any print statements.

# This is the scoring criteria:

# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

# Expected Output
# '{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable'

student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
}
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# TODO-1: Create an empty dictionary called student_grades.
student_grades = {}

# TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.ðŸ‘‡
for student in student_scores:
  if student_scores[student] > 90:
    student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
  elif student_scores[student] > 80:
    student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations"
  elif student_scores[student] > 70:
    student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
  else:
    student_grades[student] = "Fail"

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print(student_grades)

# Exercise 2: Travel Log
# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries. Your job is to create a function that can add new countries to this list.

# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Brazil to the travel_log.

# add_new_country("Brazil", 5, ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"])
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. The goal is to create a function that modifies it.

# Example Input
# Brazil
# 5
# ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"]
# Example Output
# I've been to Brazil 5 times.
# My favourite city was Sao Paulo.

country = input() # Add country name
visits = int(input()) # Number of visits
list_of_cities = eval(input()) # create list from formatted string

travel_log = [
  {
    "country": "France",
    "visits": 12,
    "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
  },
  {
    "country": "Germany",
    "visits": 5,
    "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
  },
]
# Do NOT change the code above ðŸ‘†

# TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries
# to be added to the travel_log. 
def add_new_country(country, visits, list_of_cities):
  new_entry = {
    "country": country,
    "visits": visits,
    "cities": list_of_cities,
  }
  travel_log.append(new_entry)

# Do not change the code below ðŸ‘‡
add_new_country(country, visits, list_of_cities)
print(f"I've been to {travel_log[2]['country']} {travel_log[2]['visits']} times.")
print(f"My favourite city was {travel_log[2]['cities'][0]}.")
